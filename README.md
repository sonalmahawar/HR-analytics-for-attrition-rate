# HR-analytics-for-attrition-rate
Problem Statement:
Employees are considered as an asset to any organization and each organization provide a better and flexible working environment to retain
its best and resourceful workforce.
As such, continuous efforts are being taken to avoid or extend the exit/withdrawal of employees from the organization. Human resource managers are facing a challenge to predict the exit time of employees . This project is an attempt to analyse the employees in various departments and give meaningful insight as to why they might quit the company.

About the dataset:

The data contains various columns like age, attrition(boolean value), business travel(rarely, frequently, non-travel), job role, no of years worked in the company, gender, marital status, education and many such attributes.


Job role vs attrition count:
Here we have valued job role and the attrition count for each role and found that lab technician have the highest count.

Years in current role vs years since last promotion:
For each employee we plotted the years in current role against years since last promotion and we used the filter as attrition and the orange dots we see are the ones that have the value “yes” for attrition
 
Years with current manager vs attrition count:
We have plotted the no of years with current manager vs the attrition count and discovered that people who have spent less than a year with current manager are most likely to quit.

No of companies worked vs attrition count:
We plotted the no of companies an employee has worked in vs the attrition count in an area chart


Conclusion:-
In this Project we have analyzed the data for a particular company and found out the main reasons why employees tend to leave the company, and at which stage in their career are they likely to quit, which sector has the maximum attrition count.
In the analysis of the data we found that Laboratory technicians have the highest attrition count at 62. We also found two clusters of employees when we analysed the years in current role against the number of years since last promotion and found that freshers who have just started working have a tendency to leave and people whose last promotion was  4-7 years back and have spent 4-9 years in their current role quit. We also observed that people who have spent less than a year with the current manager i.e. newly assigned, have the highest attrition count. The company could present this data to the managers and survey their performance index and talk about the discomfort freshers feel.
